# courseSEARCH
Emails user when a formerly full UBC course opens a seat. 

This would work for any university with publicly available 
course descriptions. 

Also, by slightly editing the table cell scout function in 
the body, one could use this code to do pretty much anything
of the same nature, such as getting notified immediately when
a stock value changes or when a sports score is updated. 

Of course most universities have an anti-crawling policy on 
their course webpages, so I have to include the standard 
disclaimer that this code is meant to be for theoretical
enjoyment only, except when allowed.
